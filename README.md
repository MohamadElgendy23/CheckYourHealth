# CheckYourHealth

Built using the MERN Stack

This Full Stack App allows users to sign in/sign out via JWT authentication tokens as well as be able to check if they are healthy or not based on a BMI formula. Good looking UI and a NavBar component on the top allowing users to be able to switch around the app with ease. Also has the functionality that if a user is not signed in yet, it wont allow them to be able to access the health page with route /health. Same goes for the user page; if a user is already signed in it signs them out if they try to access the page.
